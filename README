picorandr is a lightweight tool that uses the Linux kernel's Direct Rendering
Manager (DRM) to detect GPUs, retrieve their vendor and device details via PCI
addresses, and list connected display resolutions, connectors, and their specific
drivers. This specially helps laptop users understand their device's hardware and
driver scheme.

BUILDING:

        cmake -B build;
        make -C build;

INSTALL:

        sudo make -C build install;

Note 1: If you're using an NVIDIA GPU and want the program to work properly,
ensure that the nvidia_drm module is loaded first.

Note 2: If your graphics card is only used for 3D acceleration, you won't see any
DRM connectors. This is expected behavior, so no need to panic or yell at me. It's
just how it works!
