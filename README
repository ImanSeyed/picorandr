picorandr is a lightweight tool that uses the Linux kernel's Direct Rendering
Manager (DRM) to detect GPUs, retrieve their vendor and device details via PCI
addresses, and list connected display resolutions, connectors, and their specific
drivers. This specially helps laptop users understand their device's hardware and
driver scheme.

BUILDING:

EXAMPLE:
	$ picorandr;
	8086:9a49 Intel Corporation TigerLake-LP GT2 [Iris Xe Graphics]
	          Kernel driver in use: i915
	          Connectors:
	                  eDP-1 (connected)
	                          * 1920x1080
	                  DP-1 (disconnected)
	                  DP-2 (disconnected)
	                  HDMI-1 (disconnected)
	
	10de:2520 NVIDIA Corporation GA106M [GeForce RTX 3060 Mobile / Max-Q]
	          Kernel driver in use: nvidia
	          Connectors:
	                  HDMI-2 (connected)
	                          * 1920x1080

Note 1: If you're using an NVIDIA GPU and want the program to work properly,
ensure that the nvidia_drm module is loaded first.

Note 2: If your graphics card is only used for 3D acceleration, you won't see any
DRM connectors. This is expected behavior, so no need to panic or yell at me. It's
just how it works!
